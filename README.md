# SMTP_AnomalyDetection_Using_AutoEncoders


This GitHub repository is dedicated to the implementation and exploration of SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) anomaly detection using autoencoders. The project focuses on leveraging autoencoder neural networks to identify anomalies or suspicious patterns within SMTP traffic, aiming to enhance email security and detect potential threats such as malicious activities or unauthorized access.

## Overview

SMTP remains a critical component of email communication, making it an attractive target for cyber threats. This project addresses the need for an efficient anomaly detection system tailored to SMTP traffic, utilizing autoencoders, a type of artificial neural network, for unsupervised learning. The repository provides insights into the methodology, model architecture, and implementation details.

## Key Features

- **Autoencoder Architecture:** Explore the design and configuration of the autoencoder neural network used for SMTP anomaly detection.
  
- **Dataset:** Access information on the datasets employed for training and testing the model, facilitating reproducibility and experimentation.

- **Training Process:** Understand the steps involved in training the autoencoder on SMTP data, including preprocessing steps, hyperparameters, and model evaluation metrics.

- **Results and Analysis:** Review the results obtained from the anomaly detection model and gain insights into its performance in identifying deviations from normal SMTP behavior.
